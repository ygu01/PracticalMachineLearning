Practical Machine Learning Course Project â€” Find the classe of Exercise
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

  The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. 20 different test cases are predicted using the model trained by learning from the train set.
Load and cleanse the data
Read the files

trainset<-read.csv("pml-training.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
testset<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
Clean the data: remove all the columns where any of the data are N.A.

library(data.table)
DT <- as.data.table(trainset)
trainset1<-data.frame(DT[,which(unlist(lapply(DT, function(x)!any(is.na(x))))),with=F])

DT1 <- as.data.table(testset)
testset1<-data.frame(DT1[,which(unlist(lapply(DT1, function(x)!any(is.na(x))))),with=F])
refine the train and test set to make sure all column names exist in both data frames. The first 7 columns should not be used for the training and prediction.

trainnames<-colnames(trainset1)[colnames(trainset1) %in% colnames(testset1)]
trainset2<-trainset1[c(trainnames)]
trainset2<-cbind(trainset2,trainset1["classe"])[,8:60]
testset2<-testset1[c(trainnames)][8:59]

Conclusions
predicted classe of activity

print(predict(modFit1, newdata=testset2))
##  [1] B A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B
## Levels: A B C D E
The error rate of the final model (random forest) used for the prediction is 1-0.974=0.026 via corss-validated resampling. The model seemed to be quite accurate in predicting the activity.
